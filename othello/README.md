# Description of this program:

This program is a simple implementation of an AI opponent in the classic board
game known as Othello. The AI opponent uses the minimax algorith with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best choice given the available moves on the board. The rules can be found [here](https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english). Also, here is the guide I used to help me implement this program [guide](https://www.instructables.com/Othello-Artificial-Intelligence/)
