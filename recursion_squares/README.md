# Description of this program
 *  This program implements recursion to recursively draw squares using Java's stddraw JAR. This file allows for the drawing of simple
 *  2-Dimensional shapes to a pop-up window via code. There are 4 different patterns for each set of input. The patterns simply determine
 *  what squares will be drawn in what order (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right) and other possible drawing patterns.
 *  The size of the first square always stays the same. When the code is executed, you can watch the squares being recursively drawn.`
