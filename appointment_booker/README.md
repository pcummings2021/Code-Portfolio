# Project Description
This is a appointment scheduler designed in python using the package PyQt5. This program creates a 
GUI application that allows users to make appointments with a professor on a selected date. It also
blocks users from making appointments on certain holidays. Holidays are pulled using web-scraping and
the BeautifulSoup package from the Florida Tech academic calendar.
