# Description of this program
 *  This is a program that implements Java's Arraylist data structure to calculate atomic weights of substances based on their
 *  elements. Each element of the perodic table and its assigned atomic weight are given in a CSV file, which had to be read and
 *  interpreted. Once the atomic weight for the equation is calculated, it prints to standard out.
