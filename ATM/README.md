# Description of this program:
This program is a CTF Challenge I wrote for CSE-4860: Designing Cybersecurity 
competitions where our class actually hosted a live CTF challenge fully made
up of student-made challenges. This challenge is in the RE or 
"reverse engineering" category and involves some good timing. 

## Alien Time Machine (ATM)

You're out of space fuel! Luckily some dope left his alien credit card on 
the ground outside the ATM at the gas station. Fill up your tank so you 
can keep moving
