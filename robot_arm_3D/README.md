# Description of this program:
 This program uses common algorithms and linear algebra found in Computer Graphics Algorithms. The program uses numpy and vedo, a popular Python computer graphics library, to generate a 3D animated robot arm. This arm has multiple different joints with each section of the arm being placed on a different plane, and the connection being calculated through transition matrices between the different planes. Each plane needs to be created through a transition matrix from the previous plane so each plane is created with respect to the previous.
